Important advice

You have to read the ranges the following way:

For example BU:

If you have K9o for 11bb -> Jam
                for 13bb -> openraise/fold
If you have ATo for 12bb -> jam
If you have ATo for 19bb -> raise/call

Please see call rejam ranges for more infos about calling rejames! And Push ranges when becoming shorter than 10bb!


For example SB:

If you have AKo for 14bb -> Jam
                for 16bb -> Openraise/call
